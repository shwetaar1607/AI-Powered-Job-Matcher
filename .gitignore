# Gemini API Key (IMPORTANT: Keep your API key out of version control!)
# If your API key is directly in job_matcher.py, you should
# consider moving it to an environment variable or a separate
# config file that is also .gitignore'd.
# For this project, you'll need to manually ensure it's not committed
# or replace it with a placeholder before committing.
# Example:
# config.py
# *.env
# .env
